# web-dev-advanced-spring2024-react

This repo contains (React) code that we are creating for the web advanced course of Frauenloop / Spring 2024 edition.

Different stuff will be separate into branchs for organization purposes.

## React Reading list

We were coding a simple reading list using plain javascript.
The idea now is to recreate the same functionality but using React as the starting point.

The code for that will be in branch `react-reading-list`
